#
#             <service_pid>.<property_key>=<property_value>



# Note:

# Format:
#       type character followed by a quoted string representation of value.
#          e.g a boolean -  property=B"true"
#       Lowercase type character implies primitives. Type can be omitted for String.
#       Types:
#           T = String            I = Integer            L = Long
#           F = Float             D = Double             X = Byte
#           S = Short             C = Character          B = Boolean
#
#       Array format is property=<type>["<value1>","<value2>"].
#           e.g. array of int - property=i["1", "2", "3"]
